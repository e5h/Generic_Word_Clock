# Generic Word Clock

## Summary

This repository contains the mechanical, electrical, and software components for a generic and customizable word clock.

All of these components can be used together to create a personalized version, or they can be used interchangeably with existing word clocks and controllers.

This is based on the original word clock project I did in 2017 ([Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/Minimalist-3D-Printed-RGB-Word-Clock/), [GitHub](https://github.com/e5h/Word-Clock)). I created an additional mechanical word clock meant to use much cheaper and easier to assemble LED strips ([Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3011627)) based on initial feedback, but both versions were lacking.

This "Generic" version is meant to be a direct replacement and upgrade for both. There is a custom controller based on an ESP32C3 module, much better software, and a more customizable mechanical design which includes a script to automatically generate a clock face with any installed font and combination of characters.
